                        My most beautiful sister decided to gift her favorite niece a pen tablet she seldom use.
                        It so happened that her niece is my beautiful daughter, not just her who was thrilled to have it, well, me too!
                    </p>
                    <p>That pretty much how we looked like.</p>
